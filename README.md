# ipsec-rh.scripts
IPSec/Redhat scripts for pentesting and hiding things.
These scripts were written while I was setting up networks, and making sure they are safe.
These are for educational purposes only and if you use them to commit a crime, you are the one responsible for your own actions.


Atheros, BroadCom, RaLink,RealTech were announcing WPS even when its turned off.
I will be submitting reports to the vendors and ISP's who are vulnerable to the actions.
I will also be developing a gateway software to hide routers from airodump polls

Recently added: Wep cracking scripts. These are for fun, if someone decides to use WEP, I use this to show them how easy the network can be broken into. Even with mac filtering.
